Tools for Autonomous Robotic Telescope (former Bradford RT) access. This is not a finished tool. It is already usefull, but needs work for full functionality. The final goal is to create a complete pipieline for submission/processing/reduction (astrometric and photometric) of images from [ART](http://telescope.org/), and possibly other on-line telescopes. At this moment the submission by name of the object and astrometric callibration is working - at least on the basic level. You need a free account on [astrometry.net](http://www.astrometry.net/) server and API key from your profile or a local installation of the astrometry.net plate solver and data files.
